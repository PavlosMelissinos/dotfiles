My tmux config


WIP docs

I had been using Gregory Pakosz' extremely configurable tmux configuration for
years (https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux) before I decided to go back to the
basics.

I was satisfied with the out of the box experience but I didn't like that the
interface with tmux was obfuscated so much.

Notes:
- `tmux set -g mouse <on|off>` to toggle mouse on and off
- Tab isn't working
- uptime isn't refreshed in real time (you have to refresh tmux to update)
