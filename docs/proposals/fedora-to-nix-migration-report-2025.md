- **Total migration candidates**: 13 packages (Phase 1: 10, Phase 2: 3)
- **Successfully migrated**: 12 packages (92% success rate)
- **Requiring custom packaging**: 1 package (azote)
- **Download size**: 109.79 MiB
- **Installed size**: 543.08 MiB

## Technical Details

### Home-Manager Configuration Changes
Added to `.config/home-manager/home.nix`:

```nix
# Desktop applications section
kodi
blueman
gedit
rhythmbox
# azote  # Not in nixpkgs - could create custom package if needed

# Development tools section
android-tools
caddy
distrobox
go
pkg-config
toolbox

# Utilities section
sqlite  # Available as sqlite3 command
wdisplays  # Display configuration GUI
```

### Validation Results
All migrated packages passed validation:
- ‚úÖ Command-line tools available in PATH (`/home/pavlos/.nix-profile/bin/`)
- ‚úÖ Version information accessible
- ‚úÖ Basic functionality confirmed for development tools

```bash
$ go version
go version go1.24.5 linux/amd64

$ caddy version
2.10.0

$ distrobox --version
distrobox: 1.8.1.2

$ adb version
Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41
Version 35.0.1-android-tools

# Phase 2 Validation
$ sqlite3 --version
3.50.2 2025-06-28 14:00:48

$ pkg-config --version
0.29.2

$ which wdisplays
/home/pavlos/.nix-profile/bin/wdisplays
```

## Benefits Achieved

### Immediate Benefits
1. **Declarative Management**: Packages now defined in version-controlled
   configuration
2. **Reproducibility**: Exact package versions pinned in `flake.lock`
3. **Atomicity**: Changes applied atomically with rollback capability
4. **Consistency**: All user packages managed through single system
   (home-manager)

### System Architecture Improvement
- **Package Count**: Now managing 100+ packages through home-manager (increased from 95+)
- **Clean Separation**: User applications via Nix, system services via DNF
- **Version Control**: All user application versions tracked in git
- **Development Workflow**: Essential development tools (sqlite, pkg-config) now declaratively managed
- **GUI Integration**: Display management (wdisplays) integrated into user package management

## Critical Lessons Learned (VM Testing Experience)

### VM Resource Requirements
- **RAM**: Minimum 8GB required for reliable NixOS builds (4GB causes resource exhaustion)
- **Disk**: Minimum 150GB for full system builds (significantly more than initially estimated 20GB)
- **CPU**: Multiple cores recommended for faster builds (4+ cores ideal)

### UEFI Boot Setup Critical
- **Legacy BIOS**: Original documentation assumed MBR/legacy boot
- **UEFI Required**: Modern NixOS installations require UEFI firmware (OVMF)
- **Filesystem Types**: Boot failures occur if hardware-configuration.nix filesystem types don't match actual partitions

### Configuration Essentials
- **User Passwords**: NixOS requires explicit user password configuration (missing causes installation failure)
- **Hardware Detection**: Auto-generated hardware-configuration.nix needs manual verification
- **Filesystem Verification**: Critical to verify `fsType` matches actual partition format with `lsblk -f`

### Updated VM Testing Process
The original VM setup has been revised based on troubleshooting experience:
- UEFI firmware integration (OVMF)
- Proper resource allocation (8GB RAM, 150GB disk)
- Detailed partition/format process documentation
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guide added

### Migration Plan Updates
Documentation updated to prevent common failures:
- `/home/pavlos/docs/migration/migration-plan.md` - Enhanced with UEFI setup, resource requirements
- `/home/pavlos/.config/nixos/` - Configuration templates with proper filesystem types and password setup
- Troubleshooting section added covering boot failures, resource exhaustion, and configuration issues

## Next Steps

### Future Migration Candidates
Based on analysis, remaining candidates for potential future migration:
- `webex` (evaluate Nix compatibility - may have dependencies on system libraries)
- Additional development libraries as needed for specific projects
- Consider creating custom Nix package for `azote` if wallpaper management becomes essential

### Packages to Keep in DNF
These should remain system-managed for stability:
- All firmware packages (`*-firmware`)
- Kernel and boot components (`kernel*`, `grub2*`)
- Core system services (`systemd*`, `NetworkManager*`)
- Hardware drivers and support libraries

### Optional Cleanup
After confirming stability, consider removing migrated DNF packages:
```bash
# Phase 1 & 2 packages - only after confirming Nix versions work completely
sudo dnf remove kodi
sudo dnf remove pkg-config
```

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Achieved
- ‚úÖ No system stability issues
- ‚úÖ All applications functional
- ‚úÖ Easy rollback available (`home-manager switch --rollback`)
- ‚úÖ DNF packages still available if needed

### Monitoring Required
- Desktop integration (`.desktop` files, themes)
- System service interactions
- Plugin/extension compatibility

## Conclusion

Two-phase migration successfully consolidated 12 user applications and
development tools under declarative home-manager control. The process
demonstrated:

1. **High Success Rate**: 92% of targeted packages migrated successfully (12/13)
2. **System Stability**: No disruption to existing workflows
3. **Improved Management**: Enhanced reproducibility and version control
4. **Clear Architecture**: Better separation between user and system packages

The migration supports the broader goal of achieving a fully declarative,
reproducible desktop environment while maintaining system stability and
functionality.

**Recommendation**: Phase 2 migration complete with 92% success rate. Continue
monitoring for stability and consider additional tool migrations only when
specific development needs arise.

---

**Next Actions**:
1. Monitor migrated applications for any integration issues
2. Consider creating custom Nix package for `azote` if wallpaper management
   needed
3. Optionally remove DNF packages after confirming Nix versions work reliably in
   daily use
4. Document any desktop integration requirements that emerge
