## ADR Format

We follow the standard ADR format:

- **Context**: The situation that necessitated the decision
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Consequences**: The positive and negative impacts

## ADR Process

1. **Propose**: Create new ADR with "Proposed" status
2. **Review**: Discuss with stakeholders (if applicable)
3. **Decide**: Update status to "Accepted", "Superseded", or "Deprecated"
4. **Implement**: Execute the decision
5. **Update**: Reflect implementation results in the ADR
