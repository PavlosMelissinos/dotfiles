# ADR-0000: Record Architecture Decisions

**Date**: 2025-0727
**Status**: Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this dotfiles project. Architecture decisions are those that affect the structure, non-functional characteristics, dependencies, interfaces, or construction techniques of the system.

When working with a personal dotfiles repository that may be maintained across multiple Claude Code sessions over time, it becomes important to document why certain architectural choices were made. This helps future sessions understand the reasoning behind current configurations and avoid repeating the same analysis.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in his article "Documenting Architecture Decisions".

We will keep ADRs in the `docs/architecture/adr/` directory of this repository. Each ADR will be numbered sequentially and monotonically.

ADRs will follow this format:
- **Title**: Short noun phrase
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: Forces at play, technological and project factors
- **Decision**: Response to forces, written in active voice starting with "We will..."
- **Consequences**: Resulting context after applying the decision, including negative impacts

## Consequences

- Architecture decisions will be documented and preserved across sessions
- Future Claude Code instances will understand the reasoning behind current configurations
- When decisions need to change, the history and reasoning will be available
- The cognitive load of re-analyzing decisions will be reduced
- ADRs must be kept up to date when the architecture evolves
- Team members (or future sessions) will need to learn the ADR format
